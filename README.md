vCard Wizard is a Microsoft Outlook add-in and standalone software that allows you to share, export and import VCF (vCard) files for Microsoft Outlook, Exchange, Office 365, iCloud and Google contacts. A vCard file (also known as VCF) is a standard format for electronic business cards. You can open a VCF file with Microsoft Outlook, Google, iPhone, iPad and Mac, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone and most of other mobile devices.
     
You can download the free version of vCard Wizard and use it as long as you need. However, the free version has some limitations: you can only import/export up to five contacts at a time, and you cannot save multiple contacts into one vCard file. If you want to unlock these features and enjoy the full functionality of vCard Wizard, you need to buy the Pro Edition. The Pro Edition costs only $19.95 and comes with a 14-day money back guarantee. You can pay securely with PayPal or credit card.
